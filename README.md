# One-Click-Conversion-for-RS-Datasets

Realize one-click conversion of mainstream remote sensing data formats in order to adapt to [MMdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) and [MMrotation](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmrotate).

## **Introduction**

To achieve a simple and efficient RS datasets conversion experience. For rotating bboxs, we convert to DOTA format uniformly. For horizontal bboxs, we convert to COCO format. 

All conversions are available in **one click**, allowing you to experience the MM series algorithm faster. For commonly used datasets, please see the [repository](https://github.com/kongyan66/Remote-sensing-detection).
